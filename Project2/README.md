## Project Description

The aim of this project was to compare common regression methods with the MLP Feedforward Neural Network when applied to a regression problem, as well as to compare logistic regression method with the MLP Feedforward Neural Network when applied to a classification problem. See the report for detailed explanation of the scope of this project.
