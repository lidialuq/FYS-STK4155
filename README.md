# fys-stk4155
This is the code for the first project in FYS-STK 4155. There are two scripts: 

* analysis.py, which has two classes:
  * FrankeFunction() samples the franke function, which is the data used for the first exercices.
  * LinearRegression() preforms OLS, lasso and ridge linear regressions, as well as containing the methods needed to evaluate the resulting model using both bootstrap and k-fold cross validation.

* plot.py, which contains the functions that call the methods in analysis.py to get the results and make the plots in the project. The code is structured in blocks, the first containing all the functions, and the rest containing the code needed to get the results for each exercice. In order to run, click on each block and press ctrl+enter.
